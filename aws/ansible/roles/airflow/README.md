## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the role for your ansible playbook. Once launched, it will install a [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/) server in a Debian system.

### Prerequisities

Ansible 2.2.1.0 version installed.
Inventory destination should be a Debian environment.

For testing purposes, [Molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/) with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) as driver (with [landrush](https://github.com/vagrant-landrush/landrush) plugin) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) as provider.

### Installing

Create or add to your roles dependency file (e.g requirements.yml) from GitHub:

```
- src: http://github.com/idealista/airflow-role.git
  scm: git
  version: 1.0.0
  name: airflow
```

or using [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/idealista/airflow-role/) as origin if you prefer:

```
- src: idealista.airflow-role
```

Install the role with ansible-galaxy command:

```
ansible-galaxy install -p roles -r requirements.yml -f
```

Use in a playbook:

```
---
- hosts: someserver
  roles:
    - { role: airflow }
```
